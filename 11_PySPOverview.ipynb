    "Birge and Louveaux [BirgeLouveauxBook](https://software.sandia.gov/downloads/pub/pyomo/PyomoOnlineDocs.html#BirgeLouveauxBook) make use of the example of a farmer who has 500 acres that can be planted in wheat, corn or sugar beets, at a per acre cost of 150, 230 and 260 (Euros, presumably), respectively. The farmer needs to have at least 200 tons of wheat and 240 tons of corn to use as feed, but if enough is not grown, those crops can be purchased for 238 and 210, respectively. Corn and wheat grown in excess of the feed requirements can be sold for 170 and 150, respectively. A price of 36 per ton is guaranteed for the first 6000 tons grown by any farmer, but beets in excess of that are sold for 10 per ton. The yield is 2.5, 3, and 20 tons per acre for wheat, corn and sugar beets, respectively.\n",

Generally, the left-most part of each expression (e.g. “set Stages :=”) is required and uses reserved words (e.g., <span style=\"color:darkblue; font-family:Courier\">Stages</span>) and the other names are supplied by the user (e.g., “FirstStage” could be any name).

Whatever names are given here will continue to be used to refer to the stages in the rest of the file. The order of the names is important. A simple way to think of it is that generally, the names must be in time order (technically, they need to be in order of information discovery, but that is usually time-order). Stages refers to decision stages, which may, or may not, correspond directly with time stages. In the farmer example, decisions about how much to plant are made in the first stage and \"decisions\" (which are pretty obvious, but which are decision variables nonetheless) about how much to sell at each price and how much needs to be bought are second stage decisions because they are made after the yield is known.\n",
